# Calendar with Vue.js

Playing around with Vue.js

**Total time**
* Roughly 5 hours -- not a continuous session.

**Notes**
* Added field validation, transitions, and some styling.
* Normally I'd compile files for production, obfuscate (uglify) JavaScript, etc.
* I normally would have refactored some of the methods for readability / reuse.
